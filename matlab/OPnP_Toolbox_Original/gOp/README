to run the code:

1.  install Sedumi 
 ->add the path to the sedumi installation 

2. add the path of gOp             to the matlab path 
   add the path of gOp/util        to the matlab path 

3. call gOp_test -> to see if the installation works
 
4. goto Directory paper 
   -> run paper_fig -> this produces the figures, which appeard in the paper

5. have fun with the code !
