% How to use: 
%	1. compile the c files using the following lines
%       mex -O CalculateCoefficient_f3t4_Transt_1_Mex.c
%       mex -O SolvePolynomial_Sturm_Mex.c sturm.c util.c
%       mex -O Solvef_f3t4_Transt_1_Mex.c
%       mex -O SolveCubic_Real_Mex.c
%   2. run the following scripts directly for experiments

% main_pnpf_sensitivity_npoint:     Fig.2(b)
% main_pnpf_sensitivity_4point_sota: Fig.2(c)

% Scripts to reproduce the experiments with noise:
% main_pnpf_xpt_ordinary_3d: 	Corresponding to Fig.3, 1st row.
% main_pnpf_xpt_planar:         Corresponding to Fig.3, 2nd row.
% main_pnpf_noise_ordinary_3d:  Corresponding to Fig.4, 1st row.
% main_pnpf_noise_near_planar:  Corresponding to Fig.4, 2nd row.
